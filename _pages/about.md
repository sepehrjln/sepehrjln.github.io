Hello! I am Sepehr Jalalian, a systems software engineer and researcher. I recently completed my Master of Science in Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia, where I worked as a research assistant under the supervision of Prof. Alexandra Fedorova. 

I am interested in developing future system software, with focus on operating systems, databases, and distributed systems. I am passionate about preparing the system software stack to leverage next-generation hardware, and creating efficient and robust backing systems and databases for data-intensive applications and performance-critical artificial intelligence.

During my Master's, I worked on operating system support for disaggregated and heterogeneous memory backends, where I developed a framework for user space paging. Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree from Sharif University of Technology, where I worked on GPU acceleration of causal inference algorithms for machine learning.
