## Hello!

I am **Sepehr Jalalian**, a systems software engineer and researcher. I recently completed my Master of Science in Computer Engineering at the University of British Columbia, where I worked as a research assistant in [Systopia Lab](https://systopia.cs.ubc.ca) under the supervision of [Prof. Alexandra Fedorova](https://people.ece.ubc.ca/~sasha/index.html).

I am interested in developing future system software, with a focus on operating systems, databases, and distributed systems. I am passionate about preparing the system software stack to leverage next-generation hardware, and creating efficient and robust backing systems and databases for data-intensive applications and performance-critical artificial intelligence.

During my Master's, I worked on operating system support for disaggregated and heterogeneous memory backends, where I developed a [framework](https://github.com/SepehrDV2/ExtMem) for user space paging. Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor's degree from Sharif University of Technology, where I worked in [LIS lab](http://lis.ee.sharif.edu) on GPU acceleration of causal inference algorithms for machine learning.

### Looking for Opportunities

I am currently on the industrial job market and I am looking for software engineering roles. You can contact me at [sepehr.jalalian.dev@gmail.com](mailto:sepehr.jalalian.dev@gmail.com) if interested! You can find my CV [here](/files/Sepehr_Jalalian_CV.pdf).
